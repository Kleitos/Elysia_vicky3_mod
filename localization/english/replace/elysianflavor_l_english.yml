 ELY: "Elysian Empire"
 ELY_ADJ: "Elysian"
 
 ELY_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Forged by exiles from a fallen Constantinople, the Elysian Empire carved a new Hellenic order in the heart of the Americas. Rejecting the Christian world that abandoned them, they turned to the gods of old and forged a continent-spanning power through conquest, assimilation, and sheer will. Now a colossus straddling oceans and faiths, Elysia stands defiant against the monotheist world and entwined in a pagan alliance stretching from the Andes to the Eireneic seas. Will this new Rome endure, or is it destined to face the fate of the old?"

# ideology
ideology

 ideology_elysian_egalitarian:0 "Gynaikokratia"
 ideology_elysian_egalitarian_desc:0 "In Elysia, necessity forged custom. As men explored, fought, and tilled, women organized, educated, and governed. Over generations, this balance became an institutionalized matriarchy—where duty, not gender, defines power."

 ideology_elysian_economy:0 "Guild Collective"
 ideology_elysian_economy_desc:0 "After the Great Crossing, the Elysian economy was rebuilt by merchant guilds, artisan leagues, and explorer cartels. This group champions the autonomy and tradition of those collectives—decentralized yet deeply loyal to the state."

 ely_flavor.1.t:0 "The Children of the Burning City"
 ely_flavor.1.d:0 "Out of the ashes of Constantinople sailed exiles who would not kneel. Guided by the stars and ancient rites, they crossed the Oceanus Atlanticus and hewed a new dominion from the unknown wilds of the west. There, in the shadow of forgotten temples and beneath foreign constellations, they resurrected not Byzantium, but something older—something divine.\n\nWhat began as a Hellenic revival now thrives as a syncretic empire. In its temples echo the hymns of Olympians and Itzamna, of Athena and Ixchel. Its senators speak a blend of Attic dialects and native tongues. Its cities rise atop sacred mounds and Roman forums alike. The Elysian Empire is no longer the legacy of a single fallen world—but the living fusion of many.\n\nA colossus straddling continents, creeds, and oceans, Elysia stands defiant in the face of monotheist empires, a titan among gods and mortals alike. This is not merely the rebirth of an ancient order—this is the forging of a new one.\n\nNo longer a refuge—Elysia is the center of a new order. The gods have returned, and their chosen people are ready to reshape the world."
 ely_flavor.1.f:0 "“Our ancestors crossed the sea to escape a dying world. We return now, not as orphans, but as sovereigns. We are not Byzantines in exile—we are Elysians, and the world shall know the difference.”– Megistophilos Theonikos"

 eirene.1.t:0 "Basilissa Eleni"
 eirene.1.d:0 "For centuries, the Elysian throne has passed from father to son, in an unbroken line of emperors stretching back to Old Byzantium. But that legacy ends today. With the death of Emperor Konstantinos XIII and no male heirs to succeed him, his only child, Eleni, ascends to the imperial throne. Intelligent, steadfast, and beloved by the people, she takes up the mantle not as a compromise—but as a beacon of Elysia’s future."
 eirene.1.f:0 ""Since the Fates have woven this destiny for me, I shall embrace it fully, and dedicate myself to the glory of our homeland." —Basilissa Eleni Palaiologina, upon her coronation""
 eirene.1.a:0 "Long live the Empress!"
   
 fire_corps_event.1.t:0 "The Flame Rekindled"
 fire_corps_event.1.d:0 "From the fiery engines of ancient warfare to the terrifying might of our modern arsenals, flame has ever been the weapon of the Elysians. Once carried in siphons aboard dromons, now it courses through pressurized nozzles and incendiary artillery. The Fire Corps, long our symbol of divine wrath in battle, is undergoing a renaissance of discipline, equipment, and doctrine. With new fuels, precision devices, and hardened units, we set the battlefield alight—just as our ancestors did."
 fire_corps_event.1.f:0 ""It was not merely the flame they feared, but the silence that followed. Where our Fire Corps walked, only ashes remained." —General Nestor Iordanes, *Memoirs of a Campaigner*"
 fire_corps_event.1.a:0 "Let the heavens weep flame."

 fire_corps_event.2.t:0 "The Iron Fleet"
 fire_corps_event.2.d:0 "No longer bound to the legacy of copper-plated hulls and fire siphons, the Elysian Navy has embraced the future. Steam-driven dreadnoughts now patrol our coasts, equipped with heavy armor, rifled artillery, and the latest naval doctrines. The Admiralty hails this transformation as a triumph of both engineering and imperial will—one that ensures Elysia’s supremacy across the seas."

 elysian_railways.1.d:0 "Steel now stretches unbroken from the stormy shores of the Atlantic to the fertile plains of the Eireneic Basin. With the completion of this great artery, the western interior—once distant and rugged—is brought into the heart of Elysia. Trade, migration, and imperial authority will now flow freely across the continent."
 elysian_railways.1.f:0 ""With this golden spike, we declare not just the meeting of iron and earth, but of our people—east and west—united by will, bound by destiny!" —From the inaugural speech at the Corinthia Terminus"
 elysian_railways.1.a:0 "Let the West be made Elysian."

 elysian_railways.2.t:0 "The Last Spike"
 elysian_railways.2.d:0 "The final link of the Borealian-Eireneic Railway has been set, binding the icy harbors of the far north to the warm waters of the Eireneic coast. This monumental work is more than infrastructure—it is a testament to Elysian ambition, unity, and mastery over the wild frontiers. The Western Provinces, long scattered and remote, now stand poised to prosper."
 elysian_railways.2.f:0 ""As this spike is driven home, the earth echoes with the sound of a new age. One Empire, one land, one unbroken road across all Elysia." —From the speech of the Strategos of Transport at the final ceremony"
 elysian_railways.2.a:0 "Let the rails carry our empire forward."

 ely_infrastructure_event.6.t:0 "The Old Highways"
 ely_infrastructure_event.6.d:0 "As Elysian settlers advanced westward, they left behind a latticework of forts, ports, and tradeposts, bound together by dirt roads, stone-paved causeways, and ferries. This ancient network once served as the Empire’s lifeline into the interior. Yet over time, with distance from the capital and local autonomy expanding, it has fallen into disrepair and uneven oversight."
 ely_infrastructure_event.6.f:0 ""These roads were the veins of our youth, but age has slowed the pulse." — Anonymous magistrate from Pella"
 ely_infrastructure_event.6.a:0 "As long as they maintain it."

 
 ely_infrastructure_event.5.t:0 "The Oigos Marshes Drained"
 ely_infrastructure_event.5.d:0 "To tame the boglands of Oigos was no simple feat. Day by day, laborers hacked through choking weeds and drove back the ever-encroaching water. After years of toil—of sweltering heat, sickness, and struggle—dry land has finally been reclaimed, and trade now flows freely where once only mosquitoes ruled."
 ely_infrastructure_event.5.f:0 ""The Oigos Marshes are now suitable only for the haunt of noxious vermin or the resort of pestilent reptiles." — Dispatch from the Office of Provincial Engineering"

 ely_infrastructure_event.1.t:0 "Modernizing the Apaleisian Pathways"
 ely_infrastructure_event.1.d:0 "The ancient roads carved by our ancestors have been reforged in steel and stone. Our engineers, through blood and ingenuity, have bridged gorges, bored tunnels, and reinforced trade arteries that now stretch from the fertile Skythian plains to the bustling Elysian coast. This is more than infrastructure—it is the unbroken will of our people."
 ely_infrastructure_event.1.f:0 ""We built not just with tools, but with memory, legacy, and purpose." — Memoirs of the Chief Architect of the Apaleisian Route"
 ely_infrastructure_event.1.a:0 "Our ancestors would be proud."
 ely_infrastructure_event.1.b:0 "We simply can't afford it."

 ely_infrastructure_event.2.t:0 "The Lakonian Pathways"
 ely_infrastructure_event.2.d:0 "Once severed by distance and mountain, the region of Lakonia now pulses with the steady rhythm of industry. Trains whistle through tunnels carved by dynamite and sweat, ferrying goods and souls alike through paths once tread only by ox and mule. The mountains have been made to yield."
 ely_infrastructure_event.2.f:0 ""I never thought I’d hear the sound of steam through the mountain. Now I hear it in my sleep." — Ikarion, a naturalized Lakonian foreman"
 ely_infrastructure_event.2.a:0 "Truly a marvel of engineering."

 ely_infrastructure_event.3.t:0 "The Arkadian Extension"
 ely_infrastructure_event.3.d:0 "Arkadia’s long isolation has ended. The thunder of trains rolling into Isthmion echoes through the hills, heralding a new chapter of inclusion and prosperity. Where before there were only mule trails, now lie iron rails. The Empire grows closer with each arrival."
 ely_infrastructure_event.3.f:0 ""When I saw the engine pull in from Nea-Konstantinopolis, I wept. It meant we were no longer forgotten." — Elikia, Elysian settler of Arkadia"
 ely_infrastructure_event.3.a:0 "This will unite Elysia."

 ely_infrastructure_event.4.t:0 "The Hesperidian Connection"
 ely_infrastructure_event.4.d:0 "The Atlas Mountains—once a barrier dividing East and West—have been pierced by Elysian determination. With tunnels bored through granite and bridges suspended over ravines, Hesperidia is no longer a remote land at the edge of the world, but an integral part of the imperial machine."
 ely_infrastructure_event.4.f:0 ""We looked up at the mountains and saw a wall. Now, we look through them and see a gateway." — Opening address of the Strategos of Hesperidia"
 ely_infrastructure_event.4.a:0 "Even mighty Atlas will yield."

 ely_infrastructure_event.7.t:0 "The Modern Highway"
 ely_infrastructure_event.7.d:0 "With the advent of motorized vehicles—both public and private—the Empire now turns its gaze toward the ancient arteries that once bore the weight of legions and merchants. The old highways are being expanded, paved, and modernized to meet the demands of speed, efficiency, and governance. Across provinces, the journey grows shorter, and the grasp of the capital grows stronger."
 ely_infrastructure_event.7.f:0 ""Once we walked for days. Now I reach the next province by sunset. This is no road—it is power made stone." — Commentary from a merchant in Kyreneia"
 ely_infrastructure_event.7.a:0 "A worthy endeavor."
 ely_infrastructure_event.7.b:0 "We can't spare money at the moment. Best to leave it to local administration."

 ely_infrastructure_event.8.t:0 "The Inoukratis Project"
 ely_infrastructure_event.8.d:0 "When the Senate approved the annexation of Inoukratis, the critics howled—calling it a frozen graveyard unfit for empire. But beneath the ice and wind lay riches: iron, nickel, and rare ores, now flowing thanks to new extraction roads, ports, and outposts. A frigid frontier becomes a jewel of industrial promise—though not all senators are convinced."
 ely_infrastructure_event.8.f:0 ""They said we were mad to claim this place. But it is not madness that reshapes the world—it is vision." — Address from the Archon of Boreal Affairs"
 ely_infrastructure_event.8.a:0 "We will tame every corner of this world."
 ely_infrastructure_event.8.b:0 "Ha! Good one. What's next—walking on the moon?"

 ely_infrastructure_event.9.t:0 "The Thoulean Highway"
 ely_infrastructure_event.9.d:0 "The deep, forested expanses of Thoulea have long resisted Elysian reach—remote, untamed, and slow to yield. Yet with each bureaucratic reform and new engine of labor, the gap narrows. Now, a bold proposal has been introduced: a great highway stretching across the north, tying scattered provinces into the imperial heart. From the Senate floor to the lumber camps, the North begins to stir."
 ely_infrastructure_event.9.f:0 ""Some said Boreas made this land for gods alone. But our engineers have proven otherwise." — Testimony from a native-born Elysian contractor"
 ely_infrastructure_event.9.a:0 "Boréas’ realm is at our fingertips."

 ely_infrastructure_event.10.t:0 "The Modernization of the Great Cothons"
 ely_infrastructure_event.10.d:0 "Once the pride of the Punic world, the ancient cothons—those ringed harbors of Carthaginian design—have now been reborn under the tools of Elysian engineers. Reinforced docks, hydraulic lifts, and drydock systems breathe new life into the imperial fleet. With the clamor of hammers finally silenced, steamships whistle through stone gates once built for triremes."
 ely_infrastructure_event.10.f:0 ""The cothon is more than a harbor—it is civilization. Let the world come and see how an empire moors its might." — Inaugural speech from the Magister Navalis"
 ely_infrastructure_event.10.a:0 "We must admit that the Carthaginian design is appealing."

 ely_national_value.1.t:0 "Human Trafficking in Elysia"
 ely_national_value.1.d:0 "Since its founding, Elysia has struggled with chronic labor shortages. In response, darker practices emerged under euphemisms—‘Frontier’s Wives,’ they were called—enslaved women captured abroad or taken from defeated enemies. Long kept quiet, these acts are now under international scrutiny as communication with foreign powers intensifies. The pressure to abolish this practice entirely mounts like never before."
 ely_national_value.1.f:0 ""We cannot build an empire of marble upon foundations of suffering. If we wish to be eternal, we must first be just." — Senator Tryphon of Nea Athenai"
 ely_national_value.1.a:0 "Maybe it is time to put an end to this horrendous practice and move forward."
 ely_national_value.1.b:0 "Pah, what do barbarians know? Elysia will stand alone if it needs to."

 ely_national_value.2.t:0 "The New Elysian Family"
 ely_national_value.2.d:0 "Though human trafficking has been abolished, the barriers between 'true' Elysians and all others remain stark. Yet with a growing stream of immigrants seeking a better life, the Senate now debates reforms: allowing citizenship to children of mixed families, or granting full status to those who serve in arms or fall in the Empire’s name. The sacred blood laws would remain—but perhaps with new paths into the fold."
 ely_national_value.2.f:0 ""I fought in the mountains of Dacica, buried my brothers in frozen soil, and bled for the Phoenix. Am I not Elysian?" — Testimony from a veteran of Vietnamese descent"
 ely_national_value.2.a:0 "Time to create a new set of Elysian values."

 ely_national_value.3.t:0 "Elysian Education"
 ely_national_value.3.d:0 "Thanks to increased funding and a standardized, state-approved curriculum, the future of Elysian youth is now in imperial hands. From the bustling cities to the distant provinces, education molds citizens loyal to the Empire, firm in values, and proud of their history—even those born of foreign or ‘Barbaroi’ ancestry will grow into model Elysians under this enlightened system."

 ely_national_value.4.t:0 "Settling the Interior"
 ely_national_value.4.d:0 "As our people push deeper into the vast Skythian plains, the rhythm of axes, plows, and hammers echoes across new frontiers. With imperial support, settlers are founding villages and towns in once-unclaimed territory. A new Elysia is being born beyond the old heartlands—one built with courage, ambition, and the promise of fertile land."

 ely_national_value.4.a:0 "A glorious era will start."
 
 ely_national_value.5.t:0 "The Founding of the Elysian Games"
 ely_national_value.5.d:0 "The Senate has approved a proposal to create a grand celebration of Elysian unity and cultural ascendancy. Drawing inspiration from the ancient Olympic games, the Pan-Elysian Games will bring together athletes, orators, poets, and inventors from across the Empire and its subjects. More than just a contest, the Games are a declaration: that Elysian civilization—born of Hellenic wisdom, tempered by native valor, and enriched by the sciences—has no peer beneath the stars."

 ely_reform_event.1.t:0 "Great Bureaucratic Reforms"
 ely_reform_event.1.d:0 "The term 'Byzantine bureaucracy' once suited us all too well—labyrinthine systems, redundant offices, and provincial chaos. But under the steady hand of the Empress and the reforming Senate, a great reorganization has begun. A single Empire. A single code. A single administration. For the first time, the beating heart of Elysia pulses in rhythm from the tropics to the tundra."
 ely_reform_event.1.f:0 ""Where once it took five signatures to approve a well, now it takes one. And the water flows cleaner for it." — Senatorial address by Praetor Megalos"

 ely_reform_event.2.t:0 "Great Economic Reforms"
 ely_reform_event.2.d:0 "Our land is bountiful, our labor disciplined, our artisans proud. Yet for centuries we traded mostly within the Empire and her trusted allies. Now, as Elysians open their ports and minds, the world beckons with opportunity. Even traditionalists begin to see that embracing global trade may strengthen, not dilute, our unique culture and values."

 liberty_event.1.d:0 "Long ago, our ancestors closed the gates to protect Elysian purity. Only natives, settlers, and their descendants were permitted full rights. Yet in the face of global upheaval and the Abrahamic empires dividing the world, we are called to reassess. Could we offer sanctuary to those who share our pagan ways—oppressed in Europe, Asia, and Africa alike—and grow stronger through spiritual brotherhood?"

 ely_reform_event.3.d:0 "The term 'Byzantine administration' was apt to describe the systems we had established for centuries.

 ely_unification.1.f:0 "Who in these marble halls dares claim they are not the child of both the Phoenix and the Jaguar? We wear laurel and feather as one. It is time we cast aside this paper divide and stand together—not as Elysians or Elyrics—but as Elysium itself!"

 ely_unification.2.t:0 "Lakonia Joins the Heartland"

 elyric.3.t:0 "The Antheia Identity" 
 elyric.3.d:0 "Elysian scholars and imperial reformers have begun referring to the lands south of the Eireneic Isthmus as 'Antheia'—a sister realm to Elysium, shaped by similar indigenous genius and spiritual kinship. The native peoples of these lands are not foreign—they are cousins, waiting only for the light of civilization and unity."
 elyric.3.f:0 "We do not claim Antheia by conquest, but by recognition. In its rivers we see our own reflections."
 elyric.3.a:0 "The land of Antheia is just Southern Elysia if you think about it."

 ely_imperialism.9.t:0 "Expelling the Europeans"

 ely_imperialism.10.t:0 "A Polynesian Federation"
 ely_imperialism.10.d:0 "With the isles of the central Eireneic now firmly within our sphere, the Senate must decide the future of governance across Polynesia. Shall we maintain direct imperial control, ensuring these strategic waypoints remain under the unyielding watch of Poseidon’s heirs? Or shall we reward our loyal island allies with self-rule—uniting them under a federated subject in the image of Elysian governance, while preserving native leadership and tradition?"

 #Infrastructure & Pathways
 
  je_drain_marshes_ely:0 "Draining of the Oigos Marshes"
  je_drain_marshes_ely_reason:0 "The vast marshlands of Oigos, long seen as an untamed barrier, hinder the development of roads, farms, and settlements in the region. By channeling our engineers and laborers into a grand drainage effort, we shall transform these stagnant waters into fertile, productive land—reclaiming nature for the glory of the Empire."

  je_trans_elysian_railway:0 "The First Trans-Continental Railway"
  je_trans_elysian_railway_reason:0 "A single line of steel shall unite our lands — from sea to shining sea!"

  je_borealia_eireneic_railway:0 "The Borealian–Eireneic Railway"
  je_borealia_eireneic_railway_reason:0 "A rail line from the Atlantic to the Eireneic coast would open the untamed western frontier of Borealia to commerce, settlement, and control."

  je_apaleisian_pathway:0 "Modernize the Apaleisian Pathways"
  je_apaleisian_pathway_reason:0 "Built by the Exiles to connect the Elysian East Coast to the interior, the Apaleisian Pathway now buckles under the weight of modern trade. Expansion and modernization are long overdue."

  je_lakonias_pathway:0 "The Lakonian Corridor"
  je_lakonias_pathway_reason:0 "Lakonia is the second heart of our empire, yet the great mountains have long severed its ties to the north. The time has come to fulfill the dreams of the Ten Thousand and bind Lakonia to the capital."

  je_arkadias_pathway:0 "The Arkadian Passage"
  je_arkadias_pathway_reason:0 "With Arkadia's strategic importance rising through southern alliances, it is imperative to end its isolation and integrate it into the Elysian transport web."

  je_hesperidias_pathway:0 "The Hesperidian Passages"
  je_hesperidias_pathway_reason:0 "The Atlas Mountains have kept our Hesperidian kin divided for too long. Let us carve roads through stone and time."

 #Expansion, Exploration & Integration

  je_populate_interior:0 "Populate the Heartland"
  je_populate_interior_reason:0 "Our interior territories remain vast and underutilized. With peace restored, the state should sponsor colonization, development, and cultivation."

 #Reforms Education, Law & Economy
  je_elysian_schooling:0 "Establish Public Schooling"
  je_elysian_schooling_reason:0 "Universal education is the cornerstone of Elysian society. As more Barbaroi join our ranks, we must ensure every child is taught the Hellenic way."

  je_reform_blood_laws:0 "Reform the Blood Laws" 
  je_reform_blood_laws_reason:0 "Elysian social benefits are reserved for citizens alone, but many Barbaroi seek to join our civilization. Updating the blood laws may foster integration and attract fresh strength."

  je_reform_bureaucracy_ely:0 "Overhaul the Bureaucracy"
  je_reform_bureaucracy_ely_reason:0 "Our vast empire suffers from a bloated and inefficient administrative system. Without a proper census and civil registry, we govern blindly. Reform is imperative."

  je_reform_economy_ely:0 "Revitalize the Elysian Economy"
  je_reform_economy_ely_reason:0 "Though rich in land and resources, Elysia’s economy remains parochial. We must evolve from subsistence to supremacy — and become a titan of trade."

 #Religion, Ideology & Identity
  je_statue_liberty:0 "A Bastion Against Abrahamism"
  je_statue_liberty_reason:0 "Abrahamist empires spread oppression and erase native traditions under the guise of progress. Elysia, forged in exile, shall be the beacon of liberty for all who resist the lies of conquest."

  je_wife_trade:0 "End the 'Frontiers Wife Trade'"
  je_wife_trade_reason:0 "Abduction, coercion, and slavery have created a market of 'Barbarian wives' — women stripped of rights under the blood laws. This grotesque traffic dehumanizes both them and us."

  je_elysian_games:0 "Pan-Elysian Games"
  je_elysian_games_reason:0 "Long have the people of Elysium spoken of unity, spirit, and excellence. Now, we have the opportunity to formalize that ideal into a recurring cultural and civic celebration. The Pan-Elysian Games—rooted in the sacred traditions of Olympia—will stand as a festival of sport, art, reason, and the diversity of the Elysian world: from Hellenic athletics to native rituals, from philosophical oration to feats of engineering."
  je_elysian_games_complete:0 "The first Pan-Elysian Games were held to roaring success. Athletes from the four corners of the Empire competed, native dancers stunned the crowd, philosophers debated before cheering crowds, and the winning dramatist's tragedy is already being performed across the provinces. A new tradition, at once ancient and new, now unites the peoples of Elysia."



  #Defense & Security

  je_annex_aotearoa_reason:0 "The lands of Aotearoa are rich in potential — both material and strategic. They belong under the Elysian standard."

  je_reorganize_arkadia:0 "Reorganization of Antheia"
  je_reorganize_arkadia_reason:0 "With the consolidation of our influence across the Antheian provinces, the time has come to reshape the region's governance. Whether by integrating our dominions more closely or establishing a federated administration, we must forge a lasting order worthy of the Elysian legacy."

  je_reorganize_eireneic:0 "Reorganization of the Eireneic Territories"
  je_reorganize_eireneic_reason:0 "With the islands of the central Eireneic Sea now securely within our sphere of influence, the Senate must determine how best to administer these distant lands. Shall we weave them into the imperial fabric directly, or empower a federated dominion to govern in our name across the isles of Polynesia?"

 #Social Integration
 
  je_recognize_afro_americans:0 "Recognize the Free African Diaspora"
  je_recognize_afro_americans_reason:0 "Once enslaved under European yoke in Brazil, the Antilles, and La Platea, these peoples now stand free, liberated by Elysian arms and their own indomitable spirit. As they forge new societies upon the ashes of empires, it is both wise and just that we acknowledge their sovereignty, strengthen our bonds, and quietly guide their course within the Elysian sphere."
