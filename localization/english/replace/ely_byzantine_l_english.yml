# Balkans Flavour
Balkans
 
 TUR_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Once feared across three continents, the Ottoman Empire now clings to the ruins of its past. Driven from the Balkans by a united European crusade, expelled from the Caucasus by the Russians, and cast out of Arabia, Africa, and Persia by rising powers, the Sublime Porte is no longer so sublime. The empire still rules from Constantinople—but its enemies gather, and the Sword of Osman grows dull."

 BYZ_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Out of blood and ruin rose the Order of Saint Constantine—a holy alliance of Balkan peoples bound by faith and vengeance. Serbs, Bulgars, Greeks, and Romanians march beneath the imperial double-headed eagle, dreaming of a reborn Byzantium. Yet old wounds fester beneath the banners of unity, and the Russian bear eyes the east with imperial hunger. Can the Eastern Roman legacy be revived—or will the coalition crumble from within?"

 byzantine_resurgence.1.t:0 "Rhomaion’s Resurgence"
 byzantine_resurgence.1.d:0 "In the wake of the Turkish sack of Vienna in 1683, a renewed crusading fervor swept across Christendom. In this upheaval, our ancestors rose in rebellion, striking a fateful accord with the Austrian crown to reclaim the lost provinces of Rome. But though the crescent moon has waned, the Turk endures. The sacred city of Constantine still lies in Muslim hands, and the threat grows once more. If we are to survive, we must strike — not in fear, but with the fire of justice."
 byzantine_resurgence.1.f:0 ""The Empire endures not in shadow, but in steel.""
 byzantine_resurgence.1.a:0 "Strike before they rise again!"
 byzantine_resurgence.1.b:0 "Not yet — we must prepare."

 byzantine_resurgence.2.t:0 "Rhomaion Ascendant"
 byzantine_resurgence.2.d:0 "The Roman eagle soars once more over the hills and valleys of Anatolia. The tide of the Turk has been driven eastward, and with each step we reclaim the dust of our forebears. Yet the struggle is not finished. The heathen still lingers, and the wounds of our people have yet to heal. There can be no peace until the threat is utterly extinguished."
 byzantine_resurgence.2.f:0 ""Where the cross is raised, so too shall the Empire rise.""
 byzantine_resurgence.2.a:0 "We will not falter — march!"
 byzantine_resurgence.2.b:0 "Our forces must recover first."

 byzantine_resurgence.3.t:0 "Rhomaion’s Revenge"
 byzantine_resurgence.3.d:0 "Anatolia lies beneath our banner once more. The cities and fortresses of the Turks have fallen, and the Roman dominion has returned to lands it once lost. Yet the threat persists in the Levant, where the sword of Islam still glints in the sun. This is not merely a campaign — it is a reckoning. We march not only to secure our borders, but to avenge the centuries of humiliation and desecration our people have endured."
 byzantine_resurgence.3.f:0 ""Let the world remember what it means to awaken the wrath of the Romans.""
 byzantine_resurgence.3.a:0 "Press the advantage — into the Levant!"
 byzantine_resurgence.3.b:0 "Not now. Let our wounds heal."
 
 byzantine_strike.1.t:0 "An Opportunity in the West?"
 byzantine_strike.1.d:0 "Ever since the betrayal of the Fourth Crusade, when Latin greed turned Christian blades against the Queen of Cities, the Orthodox world has not forgotten. Venice, the architect of that ancient crime, once again gorged itself on Greek and Serbian lands under the guise of alliance during the wars against the Turk. But now, with the Germans and Franks distracted in their northern quarrels, the balance tilts in our favor. The time has come to reclaim what is ours — not only from the infidel, but from the Latin usurper as well."
 byzantine_strike.1.f:0 ""They took Constantinople once. They think we have forgotten. Let them be reminded in blood.""
 byzantine_strike.1.a:0 "We shall cast out the Latin thieves."
 byzantine_strike.1.b:0 "Let them have their stolen peace — for now."
 
 byzantine_strike.2.t:0 "The Scales Are Balanced"
 byzantine_strike.2.d:0 "The banners of Venice no longer fly over the lands of Hellas or the Orthodox South.

Though our wounds run deep, the Empire has reclaimed a piece of its dignity, and the people speak once more of unity, faith, and vengeance fulfilled."

Yet conquest is but the beginning; to preserve this glory, we must quell dissent, consolidate our rule, and forge a new Roman order in the East."
 byzantine_glory.1.f:0 ""For centuries, our ancestors wept over the fall. Today, they would weep with joy.""
 byzantine_glory.1.a:0 "Expel the Turks — let them return to their steppes."

The time has come to bring them home."

 byzantine_flavor.1.t:0 "The Order of Saint Constantine"
 byzantine_flavor.1.d:0 "The fall of Vienna to the Ottomans in 1684 shocked Christendom to its core. In response, a great coalition of European powers — Orthodox, Protestants and Catholic alike — took up arms to drive the Crescent from the Balkans. This new crusade, fueled by vengeance and piety, has raged for over a century. Now, the tide has turned. The Turk is driven back, clinging only to the walls of Constantinople — the Queen of Cities. In a cruel inversion of 1453, it is now *we* who stand at the gates."
