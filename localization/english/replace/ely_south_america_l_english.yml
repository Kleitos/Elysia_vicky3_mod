INC:0 "Inca"
INC_ADJ:0 "Incan"
  
TWT_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Survivors of European plague and steel, the Inca endure as highland sovereigns of the Andes. Reforged by crisis and alliance, they stand beside Elysia and Japan in a great pagan pact defying Iberian missionaries and colonial greed. Yet for all their resilience, the ancient system strains under the weight of the modern world. Will the Sapa Inca reform his empire and bring forth a golden age anew—or will the old ways shatter in the face of change?"

GRI_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "In the green heart of South America, the Guaraní Confederacy resists the steel of foreign empires. Born of mission, rebellion, and survival, they stand against Iberian ambition and British advance alike. Will the Guaraní forge a native future—or be swept away by the tide of colonization?"

BRZ_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "A jewel of Iberia, Brazil sprawls along the Atlantic coast—rich in sugar, gold, and misery. Though the elites dream of expansion inland and dominance over South America, the soul of the colony roils with unrest. Millions enslaved remember every lash, and freedom simmers beneath the cane fields."

PLN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "In the wind-swept plains of the south, Platea stands as a British outpost of order and trade. Yet raiders stalk the borders—Guaraní in the jungle, Inca from the mountains—and Brazil eyes their holdings with jealousy. Will Platea endure as a civilized bastion, or be consumed by the continent it never truly tamed?"

 ig_incan_church_desc:0 "The Kamayuq Priesthood are keepers of ancestral rites, celestial wisdom, and the moral guardianship of the Sapa Inka’s people.

 ig_incan_nobility:0 "Panaka Lineages"
 ig_incan_nobility_desc:0 "The Panaka are royal lineages descended from the Sapa Inka’s sacred bloodline.

Though clothed in the authority of the past, many now command estates, titles, and influence that echo more oligarchy than ayni."

 ig_incan_merchant_class:0 "Qhatuq Class"
 ig_incan_merchant_class_desc:0 "The Qhatuq — once humble market facilitators in the shadow of state redistribution — have emerged as powerful brokers of silver, textiles, and grain.

 je_anti_ruler_reason:0 "The *Anti Suyu*, cradle of mountain spirits and citadels, is ours by right of sun and stone. The time has come to affirm our destiny—to be the sole stewards of the sacred Andes, from clouded peak to jungle root."

 je_andean_pathway:0 "The Path of the Anti"
 je_andean_pathway_reason:0 "Our empire, hemmed in by the high ridges of the Andes, has long relied on narrow trails and ancient roads. But the Elysians carved stone and steel through their own mountains — perhaps we too may bind the empire with modern pathways, from the puna to the valleys."

 je_reform_mines:0 "Awaken the Veins of the Earth"

 ely_south_america_diplo.1.d:0 "Our earliest contact with Elysia came in the fires of war, as we fought together to repel Iberian invaders.

 ely_incan_reform.1.d:0 "The *Suyu* has weathered centuries—yet now, its foundation trembles not from war or famine, but from thought and ambition. The old *kuraka* lords, the merchant dynasties, and the priesthood debate in *Qusqu* as the *Sapa Inka* listens. Some fear erosion of order; others see the rising sun of a new era. The question is no longer whether change is coming—but who shall shape it."

 inca_glory.1.d:0 "From the mist-laced peaks of *Anti Suyu* to the sacred valleys below, no rival now challenges our dominion. The scattered *suyu* beyond look to us with reverence—or with envy. The *Sapa Inka* stands alone atop the world, not as a tyrant, but as guardian of the sacred chain. These mountains have named their master—and it is us."
 inca_glory.1.f:0 "“Let the thunder speak and the condor bear witness—these heights belong to the children of Inti.”"
 inca_glory.1.a:0 "These mountains are our home, now and forever."

 ely_incan_war.1.t:0 "The Pact Frays"
 ely_incan_war.1.d:0 "For three centuries, we stood shoulder to shoulder with Elysia and Nihon, bound by shared defiance of the Cross and Crown. We bled together against the invaders from across the sea, and in the long peace that followed, our lands became a bridge between East and West. Caravans of foreign goods wound through our valleys, while our gold and silver filled their treasuries. \n\nBut peace breeds memory, and memory decays. What once was sacred has turned sour in the mouths of our people. Elysian and Japanese merchants, once guests, now act as masters — growing fat on the wealth of our ayllus while the earthbound sons of Inti labor in their shadows. The merchant-aristocracy grows complicit, hoarding gifts from afar and feeding the old alliance with words while gutting it in spirit.\n\nNow a reckoning looms. Shall we abandon this broken friendship and rise alone? Or might we still remake the Eireneic Treaty—not as servants, but as sovereigns?"
 ely_incan_war.1.f:0 "“The apus do not forget betrayal. Let the sun judge what lies ahead.”"

 inca_infrastructure.1.t:0 "The Anti Pathway"
 inca_infrastructure.1.d:0 "The towering backbone of our empire, the sacred Anti mountains, remains both a shield and a challenge. Merchants, messengers, and the armies of old once threaded their way through ancient trails. Now, engineers whisper of new roads, tunnels, and rail that could bind our northern and southern lands like never before. Can the mountains be made to serve once more, not just as guardians—but as bridges between our peoples?"
 inca_infrastructure.1.f:0 "“We once carried chasquis over stone paths and narrow ridges. Now the chariots of thunder wish to carve their own.” – Elder of Kunturmarka"
 inca_infrastructure.1.a:0 "One spine, one pathway, one nation."

 inca_infrastructure.2.t:0 "Awakening the Mountain’s Blood"
 inca_infrastructure.2.d:0 "The Anti Mountains, long revered, hold veins of copper, silver, and gold—gifts from Pachamama beneath stone and ash. In past times, only sacred tribute was taken. But now, modern methods offer deeper tunnels and stronger tools. There is wealth to unearth—but at what cost to the spirits of the earth?"
 inca_infrastructure.2.f:0 "“We dig with care, or the mountain grows angry.” – Ñustapa guardian, Cerro Pukaqaqa"
 inca_infrastructure.2.a:0 "The heart of the earth beats stronger."

 inca_farms.1.t:0 "The Return to the Chakras"
 inca_farms.1.d:0 "Our ancestors shaped the Anti slopes into vibrant green staircases, taming altitude through ingenuity. These chakras once fed millions with maize, potatoes, and quinoa. Today, erosion and neglect eat away at this legacy. Some propose a revival—mixing old techniques with modern science—to heal the mountains and feed the people."

 inca_farms.1.a:0 "Reclaim the stone ladders of the earth."

 inca_farms.3.t:0 "Breeding on the Roof of the World"
 inca_farms.3.d:0 "The herds of the puna—alpacas, llamas, and vicuñas—have long given wool, meat, and strength to our people. But changes in demand and trade expose new potential. Better pastures, careful breeding, and textile refinement could birth a golden age for our highland herders, without forsaking tradition."
 inca_farms.3.f:0 "“Alpaca wool is not just warm. It is the thread that binds families, markets, and memory.” – Rancher from Qollasuyu"
 inca_farms.3.a:0 "The herds shall walk proudly once more."
 
 inca_infrastructure.3.t:0 "Ore Beneath Every Mountain"
 inca_infrastructure.3.d:0 "From the copper lands of the northern Tayrona to the frozen silver ridges of the southern Yawarmarka, the new lands of our empire overflow with wealth. The mountain spirits whisper of untouched veins, calling for picks and forges to awaken them."

 inca_farms.4.a:0 "From the fleece of the highland beasts, we weave unity."
 
 guano_act.1.t:0 "Empire of Sulfur and Saltpeter"
 guano_act.1.d:0 "With access to vast guano reserves along the coast and sulfur deposits in the mountains, our Empire has become the world’s foremost supplier of explosive materials. Chemists and generals alike turn their gaze to our lands."
 guano_act.1.f:0 "“All empires must dig deep — some into memory, others into the land.”\n– Head Alchemist Kusi Wiraqocha"
 guano_act.1.a:0 "This probably won't have any downside."
 
 inca_intro_event.1.t:0 "Heirs of Inti, Guardians of Tawantin Suyu"
 inca_intro_event.1.d:0 "High above the clouds of Anti Suyu, where the Apus whisper and the condor soars, the *Tawantin Suyu* endures. Forged in flame and famine, tested by pestilence and steel, the children of Inti repelled the invader and stood unbroken beside Elysia and Zipanghu.\n\nYet even as *Qusqu* thrives and the sun temple shines once more, stormwinds gather. The age of chasquis and quipus wanes. In their place rise coins, ledgers, and strange foreign ideas. The *Sapa Inka* rules still, but must now walk a path between the sacred and the new.\n\nThe world changes—but so does the *Tawantin Suyu*. Will the flame of Inti rise anew, or flicker in the shadow of the coming age?"
 inca_intro_event.1.f:0 "“We are not ghosts of stone—we are the breath of the mountain, the word in the wind, the blood of the sun. So long as *Qusqu* stands, the *Suyu* shall never fall.”"
 inca_intro_event.1.a:0 "*Tawantin Suyu* endures, as it always has."
