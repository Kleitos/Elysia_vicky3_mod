# Big European Nations
Europe

 IBE_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Defeated in the New World, Iberia lost its grip on the western continents—but clings tightly to the riches of Africa, Arabia, and Asia. Inheriting Portugal’s colonial web, the Crown now struggles to hold together a global empire under siege. Revolution in France, defiance in Morocco, and rebellion in Italy all threaten the fragile order. Will Iberia retreat into decline, or reforge itself into a bastion of monarchy and imperial resolve?"

 GBR_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Once unrivaled on the seas, Great Britain now finds itself locked in a bitter rivalry with the resurgent Elysian Empire and the still powerfull Iberian Empire. Driven from most of the New World, its ambitions now turn eastward—toward Africa and the jewel of India. Though late to the colonial race in Asia, its industrial engines roar ever faster, and its imperial pride refuses to yield. Will Britannia rise, or be eclipsed ?"

 DEN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Denmark has long punched above its weight, profiting immensely as the sole European conduit for Elysian and Asian trade. Without the burden of colonies, it outpaced the Hansa and challenged even Great Britain on the seas. Yet the tide is turning. German nationalism stirs unrest in Schleswig, and Denmark’s privileged trading position may not last. Can Copenhagen remain relevant in a world of empires?"

 SWE_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Sweden once ruled a Baltic empire stretching from Finland to northern Germany. But the sun has dimmed on its dominion—beaten back by Prussia, hemmed in by Denmark, and saved from Russian ruin only by foreign alliance. Though reduced, Sweden still controls much of the north and holds the population and spirit to dream again. Can the Lion of the North rise once more?"

 RUS_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Russian bear claws south and west, carving lands from Poles, Turks, and Persians alike. Yet every step forward brings resistance. A modernizing Iran blocks expansion in the Caucasus, China foments nomadic rebellion beyond the Urals, and Prussia stifles Baltic ambition. Still, the Tsars hold fast—dreaming of warm ports, vast steppes, and Orthodox dominion. Will Russia endure these trials to emerge a true empire, or fracture under the weight of its own reach?"
 
 NOR_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Norway has spent centuries under Danish rule, but now dreams of sovereignty. What will it take for Norway to win its independence?"

# East Asia
East Asia 
 
 JAP_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Long dismissed as an island of feudal isolation, Japan has risen with a new purpose. The Emperor, no longer a ceremonial figure, cast off the shogunate a century ago and forged a centralized throne inspired by Elysian imperialism. Bound to the Hellenic Empire and the Incas by the Eireneic Pact, Japan now strides into modernity—its traditions intact, its ambitions imperial. Will it remain a loyal ally to the old gods of Elysia, or assert its own path across the eastern seas?"

 CHI_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Qing Dynasty, vast and ancient, watches warily from behind its guarded gates. Though suspicious of foreign influence, China has chosen cooperation over confrontation with fellow Asian powers—trading through Elysia’s Eireneic network and countering European incursions by diplomacy and selective modernization. The dynasty’s hold is firm, but inward-looking. Will China’s strength endure behind its walls, or will its gates open to storm or sunrise?"
 
 KOR_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Joseon Kingdom faces a new age. Rivalry with an assertive Japan and the shifting tides of East Asia have jolted the court from its insular calm. With new reforms stirring and cautious eyes turned to modern weaponry and trade, Korea stands at a crossroads: retreat into its Confucian roots, or rise to meet the modern world with steel and sovereignty."

 TIB_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The young Dalai Lama is the theocratic leader of Tibet. Will Buddhism remain at the center of political power, or will it be displaced?"
  
 MGL_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Once the heart of the greatest land empire the world has known, Mongolia now rides under the banner of the Qing. Yet memories of thunderous hooves and golden standards have not faded. With Russian settlers pressing in from the north and the steppe’s future uncertain, some whisper of a new Khanate—one that could unite Tuva and Buryatia, defy its Qing patrons, and ride once more into legend."
 
 TUV_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "A distant vassal of the Qing, Tuva lies tucked between the steppe and the taiga, watching as Russian and Chinese empires close in. Though often overlooked, its riders still guard the mountain passes, loyal for now—but bound by traditions that answer to older thrones than Beijing or Moscow."

 BRY_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "At the edge of the Siberian frontier, the Buryats serve the Qing as a buffer against Russian ambition. Half-steppe, half-taiga, their lands are scattered and their loyalties divided—between old Mongol heritage, Qing stability, and a growing awareness of their precarious future."

 SIB_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Vast, cold, and forgotten—Siberia remains a wilderness of ice and forest, ruled more by climate than men. Though nominally an Elysian protectorate, in truth it governs itself with quiet autonomy. Rich in resources but poor in population and power, Siberia is less a nation than a question: will it be left to endure in solitude, or seized by empires hungry for land and gold?"

  
# South-East Asia
Indochina

 SIA_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Siam has established itself as the dominant regional power in South-East Asia under the Rattanakosin dynasty. But will Siam manage to reform its economy and society for the modern age?"
 DAI_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "A newly reunited Vietnam emerges from centuries of division and strife. Will Dai Nam consolidate itself and build a great nation, or is it destined to be divided once more?"
 BUR_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "It took many bloody conflicts to establish the Third Burmese Empire, and it seems that the struggle is far from over as the British Empire makes its ambitions known. Will Burma become yet another British colony, or will it stand strong against the foreign invaders?"
 CAM_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Cambodia has fallen far since the golden age of the Khmer Empire. Can the Khmer state rise once more, or will this dark age last forever?"
 LUA_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Once the seat of the mighty Kingdom of Lan Xang, Luang Prabang is a shadow of its former self. Split between the regional powers of Dai Nam and Siam, can the Lao people emerge strong and independent?"

Indonesia and Malaysia
 
 LAN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Republic of Lanfang was established by a democratic syndicate of Chinese miners hoping to exploit the gold reserves of Borneo. Can Lanfang achieve the prosperity it seeks?"
 
 ACE_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Aceh Sultanate is experiencing a resurgence in power due to the efforts of the Raja Muda. Can Aceh restore its empire and assert its independence in the face of British expansion?"
 
 BRU_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Brunei has so far repelled the attempts of colonial powers to infringe upon its sovereignty. Will Brunei fall into decline and obscurity, or could it once more become a regional power?"
 
 JOH_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Johor occupies a precarious position as the British greedily eye their territory. Will Johor manage to retain what little sovereignty it has left?"
 
 KTI_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Deep in the jungles of Borneo, the Kutai kingdom holds fast to its land and lineage. Split between Muslim coastal cities and pagan Dayak heartlands, it walks a tightrope of tradition and ambition. Will Kutai unite the island—or fall to foreign gold and gunpowder?"

 BAL_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Under Elysian protection, the Balinese kingdom has cast off foreign rule and reclaimed the Spice Islands. Java, Sulawesi, and Celebes now trade in gold and incense—but beneath the temples and ports, conflict simmers. Can Bali root out Sunni resistance and stand firm against encroaching colonialism?"

 PHI_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Philippines, baptized in Iberian fire and faith, dreams of unity. From Luzon to Visayas, its rulers seek to consolidate power—but Muslim sultanates in Mindanao and Sulu still resist the cross. Will Manila forge a true archipelagic empire—or ignite another holy war?"

 SUL_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Sultanate of Sulu clings to its sovereignty in the southern seas. Proud, defiant, and still feared on the waves, it resists Christian domination from the north. Can Sulu reclaim its lost influence—or will it be consumed by colonial crusades?"

 MGD_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "In the highlands and jungles of Mindanao, resistance endures. Moro warriors refuse to yield their lands or their faith to Iberian-backed forces in Manila. Yet even as pressure mounts, there are whispers of unity among the southern tribes. Could Mindanao rise from defiance to dominance?"


# Australia
Australia
 NSW_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "In its transition from penal colony to Crown Colony, New South Wales has seen its territory reduced as the other provinces gained their own administrations. What does the future hold for Australia?"
 SAS_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "South Australia was granted its own administration only two years ago, separating from New South Wales. What does the future hold for Australia?"
 WAS_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Swan River colonists impose upon the traditional lands of the aboriginal people, culminating in the Pinjarra massacre only two years ago. How will the colony settle this conflict?"
 TAS_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Van Diemen's Land is the primary penal colony in British Australia. What does the future hold for this colony of convicts?"

 AOT_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "United under the banner of whakapapa and mana, the Māori tribes of Aotearoa stand as guardians of their land and traditions. Backed by distant Elysia and wary of British encroachment, they must decide: isolate, adapt—or fight. Will the long canoes once again cross the waves in defiance?"


# Poland
Poland

 KRA_FLAVOR_TEXT:1 "The legacy of the Polish people rests heavily on the shoulders of the Free State of Krakow, distrusted by its constituting powers and occupied by Austria. Can a new Polish state rise from the ashes once again?"
   
#Central Asia
Turkic Tribes

 KOK_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "In the shadow of the Tian Shan, Kokand stands defiant amidst imperial storms. Between Qing legions, Russian ambitions, and a resurgent Persia, it remains a crossroads of faith and fire. As courts bicker and borders shift, a deeper dream lingers—of a united Turkic realm, proud and sovereign, rising from the dust of shattered khanates."
 
 XIN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Bound to the Qing court yet ruled from afar, the Uighur lands of Xinjiang lie where mountains meet desert. Trade passes through, armies pass over, but the people remain—watching. Caught between empires and identities, will the Uighurs shape their fate, or be shaped by others?"

 KAZ_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Nomads of the open steppe, the Kazakhs have long defied the reach of empires. But the age of riders is fading, and new maps are being drawn by foreign hands. Will the Kazakhs endure as free men beneath the wide sky—or be swept beneath the boots of Russian and Persian ambition?"

 TRI_FLAVOR_TEXT:1 "Following a long period of de facto independence, Tripolitania has fallen under Moroccan rule. Will the Barbary Pirates sail again?"
 
 TUN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "After being forced to end its sponsorship of piratical raids, the Tunisian economy has taken a turn for the worse. Can the Bey restore prosperity?
 
 MOR_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Morocco has defied the European tide. In an age of empire, it cast out Iberian invaders and turned its eyes east—dominating the Maghreb and ousting Ottoman influence. Through pragmatic diplomacy and trade, it has enriched itself and sidestepped European blockades. But Iberia still clings to key ports, and Morocco’s ambitions may provoke a wider reckoning. Will the lion of Africa roar louder still?"

Nile River

 EGY_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Once the jewel of the Ottoman world, Egypt has slipped into uneasy independence amid the empire's collapse. Stripped of its role as guardian of the holy cities and shut out from the Red Sea by an Iberian-backed Ethiopia, Cairo seethes with wounded pride and rising zealotry. With its Maghrebi ambitions lost to Morocco and the heart of Islam drifting beyond its grasp, Egypt must choose, embrace reform or fall deeper into reaction."
 
 ETH_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "From the highlands of Axum to the ports of the Red Sea, Ethiopia has cast out foreign faiths and reclaimed its ancient strength. Allied to the Iberians and resurgent in the Horn of Africa, the Solomonic dynasty now eyes the Nile and the Coptic lands under Egyptian rule. But empire breeds dependency—and as Iberian ambitions grow, Ethiopia must decide whether to remain the faithful ally, or carve a new path through an age of imperial reckoning."


# Africa
Subsaharan Africa  

 SOK_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Forged by the Fulani Jihad, the Sokoto Caliphate stands as a bulwark of Islamic reform and expansion in West Africa. With its armies fanning across the Sahel and its scholars shaping a new Islamic order, Sokoto dreams not only of unity—but of hegemony. As foreign powers encroach and Ashanti stirs on the coast, the Caliphate must decide: consolidate the faithful, or challenge the unbelievers abroad?"

 ASH_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Ashanti gold no longer flows through foreign ports. The Europeans have been cast out, and with Elysian knowledge and arms, Kumasi builds a new kingdom upon old strength. Ashanti eyes the Gulf of Guinea and dreams of a federation bound not by chains, but by culture and trade. Yet Sokoto rises inland, and old European forts linger—watching, waiting, scheming."

 SIL_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Once a Portuguese outpost of trade and bondage, Sierra Leone is now the Iberians' foothold in coastal West Africa. From the fortified cities and beyond, Iberians venture inland to claim dominion—but their presence is challenged by ambitious native kings and the watchful eyes of Britain beyond the riverbanks."

 KON_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Baptized in Iberian rites and armed with foreign muskets, the Kingdom of Kongo seeks unity in a land long fractured. While its kings kneel to Lisbon, their hearts burn with dreams of a Congolese empire—Christian in name, African in soul. How long before the cross borne from Iberia is held aloft in defiance, rather than submission?"

 SAF_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "A relic of Dutch ambition, South Africa has survived through French arms and Protestant tenacity. Refugees, reformers, and restless Boers till its soil and patrol its frontier. Though distant from the capitals of Europe, this frontier colony may yet forge its own destiny—be it as a southern bastion of empire or the seedbed of a new nation."

 ZIM_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "From the ruins of Great Zimbabwe rises a kingdom reborn. With Kilwa gone and Iberian claws at the coast, the rulers of the Zambezi basin seek strength in unity—and friendship in unexpected places. Allied with the pagans of the West and wary of missionaries from the South, Zimbabwe prepares to stand not just as a kingdom, but as a counter to empire."

 MAD_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Madagascar, jewel of the Indian Ocean, has cast off the Dutch and Iberians with the aid of Elysian ships and silver. As a proud member of the Eireneic Pact, the Merina dynasty now modernizes its court and armies with overseas trade and Hellenic science. But in the shadow of fortune, enemies gather—and isolation is no longer an option."


# India
India
  
 BIC_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Bengal is theirs—for now. The British India Company, born of ledgers and powder, dreams of empire across the subcontinent. But the sun does not shine without shadows: a wary Parliament, Iberian interference, and a thousand Indian princes threaten to reduce ambition to ashes. Will the Company become a Raj—or a relic?"
 
 CUB_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "From the golden sands of Gujarat to the ports of Goa, the Iberian India Company casts its net wide. Once allies of the Marathas, they now rule in betrayal’s wake, a foreign crown on native soil. Eager to outmaneuver the British, they face revolt, resistance, and rivals—but also the intoxicating promise of an Iberian Orient."

 MUG_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Once emperors of all India, the Mughals now rule a fragment—but they remember. Their banners still fly over Delhi, and the court whispers of vengeance, reform, and rebirth. Surrounded by usurpers, foreigners, and rebels, the dynasty must choose: wither quietly, or rise and reclaim the Peacock Throne by fire and steel."

 PAN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Khalsa marches. Victorious in the north and unyielding in faith, the Sikh Empire rises amidst the ashes of the Mughals and the chaos of invasion. With a sword in one hand and scripture in the other, they shape a new order—one where Punjab stands sovereign. Can this flame of conquest become the forge of empire?"

 HYD_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "In the heart of the Deccan, a court of poets, mystics, and viziers defies the tide. Hyderabad stands as a Shi’a stronghold amidst a sea of Sunni kings and foreign ambitions. Patron of Persianate culture, friend to neither Mughal tyrant nor foreign trader, the Nizam walks a knife’s edge—dreaming of a Deccan reborn, sovereign and sublime."

 SIN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Where desert meets delta, Sindh walks a careful path between the worlds of Persia and Hind. A Sunni state guided by Sufi mysticism and pragmatic rulers, it aligns closely with the modernizing Iranians—for now. With the Indus under its sway and old cities stirring with ambition, Sindh may yet rise as a kingmaker—or king—in a fractured subcontinent."

 DRA_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "In the lush, ancient lands of the south, the kingdoms of Dravistan stir. Neither Mughal nor Maratha, and no friend to foreign flags, the kings and chiefs of Tamilakam, Mysore, and beyond eye each other warily—yet share a common dream: a Dravidian order, ruled by the south, and free from northern conquest or foreign coin."
