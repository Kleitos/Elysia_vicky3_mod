	# jk. Couldn't find estimates for Guerrero in 1830 or 1840, but they could be found for 1870 onwards, so some math trickery was done. Neighboring Oaxaca's estimated 1835 population is 74.7% of its 1870 population, and 50.61% of its 1900 population, so those percentages were applied to Guerrero's 1870 and 1900 population figures, and the two results were averaged together into the above.
